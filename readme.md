Collection of scripts implementing the finite-sample approach to quantum metrology in:

    J. Rubio Jim√©nez, Non-asymptotic quantum metrology: extracting maximum information from limited data, 
    PhD thesis, University of Sussex (2020); arXiv:1912.02324.

While these scripts were originally developed with the examples therein in mind, they can likely be adapted to other a wide range of modern metrology problems.
